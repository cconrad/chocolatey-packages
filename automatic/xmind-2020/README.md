## Trial version
XMind 2020 is commercial software (unlike [XMind 8](https://chocolatey.org/packages/xmind)). You need a subscription plan for personal and business use. Before purchase, you’re using a trial version. It's for evaluation purposes only. Some features are inactive and all exported images and PDFs come with watermarks.
