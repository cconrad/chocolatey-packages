    <description><![CDATA[**calibre is a powerful and easy to use e-book manager**. Users say it’s _outstanding_ and a _must-have_. It’ll allow you to do nearly everything and it takes things a step beyond normal e-book software. It’s also **completely free** and _open source_ and great for both **casual users** and computer experts.

### Save time on managing your e-book collection

calibre’s user interface is designed to be as simple as possible. **Large buttons** in the main window take care of most of your needs. The vast number of calibre’s features and options is always clearly displayed under **intuitive tabs**. Its context menus are neatly sorted, so the things you’re looking for almost find themselves on their own. **You’re never more than three clicks away from your goal.** It’s the result of years of tweaking calibre’s interface based on users’ feedback. Plus, you can change many aspects of how calibre looks and feels, and try one of the three built-in library views to browse your book collection using covers, titles, tags, authors, publishers, etc.

calibre not only can **download all the metadata** for an e-book (things like title, author, publisher, ISBN, tags, cover or summary) but will also allow you to edit or create metadata in existing or new fields. That way you can track which books you’ve read and which ones you liked. You can also take advantage of the **advanced search and sorting** functions that use tags, authors, comments and more. You will find the book you were looking for in seconds!

### Use it everywhere and with anything

calibre supports almost **every single e-reader** and is compatible with more devices with every update. You can transfer your e-books from one device to another in seconds, **wirelessly** or with a cable. And you don’t need any additional tools to do that. calibre will send the **best file format** for your device converting it if needed, automatically.

No matter what PC, laptop or tablet you use, calibre’s got you covered. If you’re traveling and don’t have your device with you – you can take calibre on a USB stick and **use it wherever you are**. Or run the calibre Content server and read your books anywhere, on any device.

calibre can convert dozens of file types. No matter where you got your e-book from, it’ll be ready for your device in no time. When converting, you can also automatically change the book’s style, create a table of contents or improve punctuation and margins. calibre will also detect the format that’s best suited for your device on its own, so you don’t have to bother.

calibre can also turn your personal documents to e-books or create them from scratch. It can also take all the mundane things that go with it off your plate. It has automatic style helpers and scripts generating the book’s structure. You focus on the content, calibre will take care of the rest.

### Comprehensive e-book viewer

calibre has a built-in e-book viewer that can display **all the major e-book formats**. It has full support for Table of Contents, highlighting, bookmarks, CSS, read aloud, a reference mode, printing, searching, copying, multi-page view, embedded fonts, and on and on…
    
### Download news/magazines from the web

calibre can make sure you know what’s happening and **automatically deliver stories** to your device from hundreds of news sources like The Economist, New York Times, New Yorker Magazine, The Guardian, BBC News, National Geographic, CNN, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The Atlantic, Scientific American, Wired Magazine, The Telegraph, Forbes, Ars Technica…

You can also teach calibre to deliver news from completely different sites or take advantage of any **RSS feed**. No searching, no waiting, no hassle.

### Share and backup your library easily

calibre comes with a **handy web server** to host your library. In just a few moments you can **safely share** all (or just some) of your e-books with anyone you choose or access them yourself from anywhere, using any device you like. With the server, you can read the books in your calibre library on any phone/tablet using just a browser. It even works offline.

calibre has also some useful backup and import/export features that will guarantee the safety and portability of your book collection with minimal fuss.

### Edit the books in your collection

For the e-book nerds amongst you, calibre has a built-in editor that allows you to **edit e-books** in the most popular e-book formats, EPUB and Kindle. The editor has many sophisticated features to make editing the innards of e-books as easy and efficient as possible.

### Satisfy every e-book need and get support

It’s unlikely, but if you find out there’s a feature you need but calibre lacks it, you can use the **built-in plugin explorer**. Many users develop plugins to enhance and expand calibre’s features. You can browse through **hundreds of plugins** directly from calibre and install them with just one click.
