    <summary>Scrivener is a word-processing program and outliner designed for authors.</summary>
    <description>
      <![CDATA[### For writing. And writing. And writing.
Scrivener is the go-to app for writers of all kinds, used every day by best-selling novelists, screenwriters, non-fiction writers, students, academics, lawyers, journalists, translators and more. Scrivener won't tell you how to write—it simply provides everything you need to start writing and keep writing.
    
### Grow your manuscript your way
Tailor-made for long writing projects, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don't know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.

### See the forest or the trees
Whether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: hammer out every last detail before typing a word, or carve out a draft and restructure later. Or mix your methods and do a bit of both. In Scrivener, everything you write is integrated into an easy-to-use project outline. So working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a click away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.

### Research within reach
Need to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand, and you can open it right next to your work. Write a description based on a photograph. Transcribe an interview. Take notes about a PDF file or web page. Or check for consistency by referencing an earlier chapter alongside the one in progress.

### Getting it out there
Once you're ready to share your work with the world, compile everything into a single document for printing, self-publishing, or exporting to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still satisfy those submission guidelines.

    <releaseNotes>
      <![CDATA[
**Important:** This is a major overhaul of the underlying code to modernise the infrastructure to Qt 6. As a result of this framework upgrade, the minimum supported operating system is now 64-bit Windows 10.

This update fixes a number of bugs that were found in the initial 3.1.5.0 update, including a flaw in Print/PDF output that could leave some text missing. It is recommended you upgrade at your next convenience, or before compiling anything important to PDF.

  If you have attempted to update from an older system and find yourself with a copy that no longer runs, please uninstall and visit our legacy download page to fetch an older copy of the software.

### Refinements and Changes

* Adjusted the Dark Mode theme to use a darker text highlight for project search results, keeping the light-coloured text readable.

  _Note: If the Dark Mode theme is in use when upgrading to 3.1.5.1, you will need to switch to another theme and then back to Dark Mode to see the changes._
* Increased the adjustability of the text-to-speech rate and pitch sliders, allowing fine-tuned control of the settings.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug whereby arbitrary chunks of text could be missing from a compiled PDF.
* Fixed an error related to text-to-speech services that occurred on some systems and prevented Scrivener from launching.
* Fixed a bug whereby some imported webpages would not display in the editor and might prompt to select an alternative application to open the MHT file. This also fixes
  * A related issue of the Compile Format Designer window giving the same prompt.
  * An inability to complete the in-software purchasing of an upgrade or cross-platform discount.
* Restored copying and pasting formatted text from Scrivener to other applications like Word and OpenOffice Writer, which broke in 3.1.5.0 so that formatting was lost on paste.
* Fixed a bug whereby most paragraph settings were omitted when using Format ▸ Copy Formatting and ▸ Paste Formatting.
* Fixed a bug whereby after-paragraph spacing did not correctly apply when creating new list items.
* Fixed a bug introduced in 3.1.5.0 whereby the Notes Background colour in the Options:Appearance settings did not affect the interface.
* Fixed a bug whereby a custom Comments & Footnotes Area Background colour was not preserved through closing and reopening Scrivener when applied in any but the Default theme.
