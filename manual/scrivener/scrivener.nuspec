    <summary>Scrivener is a word-processing program and outliner designed for authors.</summary>
    <description>
      <![CDATA[### For writing. And writing. And writing.
Scrivener is the go-to app for writers of all kinds, used every day by best-selling novelists, screenwriters, non-fiction writers, students, academics, lawyers, journalists, translators and more. Scrivener won't tell you how to write—it simply provides everything you need to start writing and keep writing.
    
### Grow your manuscript your way
Tailor-made for long writing projects, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don't know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.

### See the forest or the trees
Whether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: hammer out every last detail before typing a word, or carve out a draft and restructure later. Or mix your methods and do a bit of both. In Scrivener, everything you write is integrated into an easy-to-use project outline. So working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a click away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.

### Research within reach
Need to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand, and you can open it right next to your work. Write a description based on a photograph. Transcribe an interview. Take notes about a PDF file or web page. Or check for consistency by referencing an earlier chapter alongside the one in progress.

### Getting it out there
Once you're ready to share your work with the world, compile everything into a single document for printing, self-publishing, or exporting to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still satisfy those submission guidelines.

    <releaseNotes>
      <![CDATA[### Refinements and Changes
* Removed unintentional advertisements that appeared several places in the machine translations for Simplified Chinese and also made several user-provided corrections to the translations. Thank you!
* Restored the Russian ru-yo and ru-ie dictionaries that were accidentally removed in 3.1.
* Removed several English variants from the interface translation options, as they did not differ from the default US English.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug that allowed saving an unzipped backup over the original project, causing Scrivener to crash and both the project and backup to be lost.
* Fixed a bug that caused a crash when checking spelling in a Scrivenings session without any misspellings.
* Fixed a bug whereby using Save As in a project set to sync with an external folder retained the external folder file path in the new copy. An external folder should sync with only one project to avoid conflicts.
* Fixed a bug whereby moving paragraphs in the editor via Edit ▸ Move ▸ Move Up/Move Down caused them to lose their paragraph formatting (alignment, indentation, etc.) and paragraph style, if one was set, and could also impact the formatting of adjacent paragraphs.
* Fixed a bug whereby reloading a linked image from disk via the context menu did not update its dimensions.
* Fixed a bug introduced in 3.1 that broke File ▸ Export for a multiple selection.
* Fixed a bug whereby the spelling dialogue did not appear when checking spelling in a Scrivenings session if the initially focussed document did not contain any spelling errors.
* Fixed a bug whereby text containing links to inspector comments or footnotes retained those links when pasted into a comment or footnote.
* Fixed a bug introduced in 3.1 whereby copying text from within an inline notation and using Paste and Match Style pasted only an asterisk rather than the copied text.
* Fixed a bug introduced in 3.1 whereby document templates were disabled in the Add Item submenu of the corkboard and outliner.
